# DySTANet
The evolution of wireless communications toward fifth-generation (5G) is driving unprecedented spectral congestion, forcing cellular technologies like long-term evolution (LTE) and 5G into frequency bands traditionally occupied by incumbent radar systems. This convergence creates a critical need for intelligent spectrum sensing (SS). In this work, we introduce DySTANet, an advanced SS method for radar and next-generation wireless networks, featuring an innovative multi-stage encoder-decoder architecture that integrates a dynamic receptive field mechanism. This innovative model is designed to precisely segment 5G, LTE and radar signals by identifying the spectral content based on the frequency and time occupied by the signals. DySTANet facilitates an effective extraction of both local and global spectral features, enabling robust analysis of wideband spectrograms under diverse signal and challenging channel conditions. The experimental results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of DySTANet: with a compact architecture of only $6.6$M parameters, it achieves a state-of-the-art global accuracy of $98.33\%$ and a mean intersection-over-union (IoU) of $96.97\%$. These results demonstrate DySTANet as a highly competitive and practical solution for real-time SS in next-generation wireless systems.
